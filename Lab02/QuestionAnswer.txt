QUESTION: Can you try to estimate which of the following has the highest spectral 
efficiency: BPSK, 4-QAM, 16-QAM, 64-QAM after observing the number of transmitted 
symbols in each modulation?

ANSWER: 64-QAM has the highest spectral efficiency because it transmits 6 bits 
per symbol, making better use of the available bandwidth compared to 
BPSK (1 bit per symbol), 4-QAM (2 bits per symbol), and 16-QAM (4 bits per symbol). 
However, higher spectral efficiency comes at the cost of increased susceptibility 
to noise and interference.
